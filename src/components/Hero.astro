<h1 class="text-4xl/12 font-bold">Hi! Carsten here ðŸ‘‹.</h1>
<p class="text-3xl/12 font-bold">Welcome to my small corner of the internet.</p>
<div class="text-lg">
  <p>
    This is <a href="/about" target="_self">personal website</a>, where I share
    my thoughts, experiences, things I collected and things I value.
  </p>
  <p>
    As someone who loves technology and podcasts, Iâ€™m excited to invite you to
    explore my different interests and find ideas that inspire you! In my blog,
    youâ€™ll find a collection of notes, ideas, and links to websites I enjoy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to look through my digital collection and let your imagination
    wander. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts, so please share your ideas with me!
  </p>
  <p>
    This space is also my creative playground, where I share my reflections to
    learn and inspire others. Iâ€™ve created this digital garden to grow my
    passions openly. A â€˜digital gardenâ€™ is a reminder of the early days of the
    internet, when people shared their interests just for fun, without worrying
    about clickbait and numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join me on this journey as I share my process, not just the final results.
    Together, letâ€™s explore the world of digital thoughts and exciting
    discoveries.
