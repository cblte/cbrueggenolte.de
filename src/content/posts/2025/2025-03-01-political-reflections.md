  The Trump administration announced significant cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),
  planning to eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contracts,
  totaling a reduction of $54 billion.
  This move has raised concerns about the U.S.'s ability to respond to global crises.

  have strained relations with global allies.
  Tensions regarding Ukraine and Russia have further exacerbated these issues,
  leading to a period of significant upheaval and restructuring under Trump's leadership.

**Thoughts on the 2025 German Elections**

- [Al Jazeera – Charting the Rise of Germany's Far-Right AfD Party](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/24/charting-the-rise-of-germanys-far-right-afd-party):
  In the February 2025 German federal election,
  the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) doubled its vote share to 20.8%,
  becoming the second-largest party in the Bundestag.
  This significant increase has reshaped Germany's political landscape and raised concerns among democratic institutions.

- [Reuters – Merz's Spending Plans](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/merzs-spending-splurge-risks-blowback-among-german-conservatives-2025-03-24/):
  Friedrich Merz,
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting,
  faced mixed reactions after announcing plans to ease caps on government spending.
  This shift towards higher debt has caused discontent among conservative members of his party and voters,
  potentially benefiting the AfD.

- [The Loop ECPR – 2025 German Election Analysis](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-2025-german-election-far-right-surge-and-coalition-collapse/):
  The Free Democratic Party (FDP),
  led by Christian Lindner,
  experienced a significant decline in the 2025 election,
  with their vote share dropping to 4.3%,
  resulting in the loss of all their Bundestag seats.
  This outcome contributed to the collapse of the previous coalition government.

- [Wikipedia – 2025 German Federal Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_German_federal_election):
  The AfD's rise has brought attention to its members known for extreme nationalist rhetoric and controversial ties.
  The party's increased representation grants it significant parliamentary privileges,
  raising concerns about its influence in security and intelligence oversight.
