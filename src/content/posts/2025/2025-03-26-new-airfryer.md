Yesterday, I went to a friend's place to chat about his home lab and network
setup. I found out he's got a Ninja Air Fryer. They're pretty cool, and you can
cook a lot with them. My wife was also talking about the Ninja brand every now
and then.

After watching a few videos about the different Ninja products, we were pretty
impressed by the [Ninja 12-in-1 Combi Cooker](https://www.ninjakitchen.de/produkte/ninja-combi-12-in-1-multikocher-ofen-heissluftfritteuse-sfp700eu-zidSFP700EU). We did some more research and watched
more videos about it. We decided to go for it and ordered one. It arrived today.
It's impressive how fast things can be here in the Netherlands.

The device is a bit larger than our current model, a [Cosori Dual Blaze](https://cosori.com/products/dual-blaze-air-fryer) that's seen better days. The Ninja has a lot more features, but the main thing that caught our eye was the ability to cook with steam. We've always wanted to try that, but never had the chance.

We got it delivered today, so we had to give the device a chance to prove its
capabilities. My wife made dinner with it. She cooked potatoes with green beans
and "protein source"—a piece of pork. The potatoes and beans turned out nice and
tender, and the meat was juicy. We also used the [Meater](https://store-de.meater.com/products/meater-plus) temperature probe to
check the meat's temperature.

After dinner, I cleaned it and used the kitchen machine to make some dough for
bread. The dough rose really well with the steam function — it looked great.
Baking the bread after another fold and rest went really well. The bread turned
out fluffy and the crust was super crunchy. I think we'll be using the steam
function more often in the future.
