I spent some time completely reworking my blog software.
Instead of Python-Flask and Hugo, I am now using [Astro](https://astro.build)—
and I couldn't be happier with the switch.

![A new blog software comes to life](./2025-03-31-cover.jpg "A new blog software comes to life")

## Why the change?

My old Python-Flask setup worked just fine
—until it didn't.
With my next role in web development and my current [full-stack web development bootcamp](https://bootcamp.dev),
this seemed like the perfect excuse to tinker with something new
(and maybe justify all those hours watching JavaScript tutorials).

## Starting Fresh with Astro

I decided to start from scratch
—because apparently I enjoy the digital equivalent of burning everything down and rebuilding.
Beginning with Astro's minimal template,
I added features one by one like build something with LEGO.
The setup was surprisingly straightforward
—I had a basic site running within minutes.
I'm still learning the framework,
getting more and more comfortable with its component-based approach,

## Migration in Progress

I'll be gradually migrating old blog posts
to this new format from my previous blog system.
While I don't have a fixed timeline
(let's be honest, it'll take as long as it takes),
I'm aiming to finish most migrations by summer 2025,
or whenever the motivation strikes.

## Learning Curve

As someone whose JavaScript knowledge previously ended at "alert('Hello World')",
this transition has been... educational.
Asynchronous programming concepts have been particularly difficult to grasp
Nevertheless, I'm making daily progress and enjoying the learning process,
even if my search history is now 90% "JavaScript promises explained like I'm five."

## Astro's Advantages

What I appreciate most about Astro is its performance and component-based architecture.
The partial hydration approach means my blog loads faster than ever.
The built-in Markdown support has simplified content creation,
and the community plugins have saved me countless development hours
(which I've promptly reinvested in overthinking my colors).

## To Sum It Up

Switching to Astro represents both a technical upgrade
and a step in my professional development
Moving from a custom Python solution to Hugo (which I used way too long)
to a modern JavaScript framework
aligns perfectly with my career trajectory in fullstack development.
Plus, I have a habit of making things more complicated than they need to be.

Though the migration takes time,
the improved maintainability and smoother development experience make it worthwhile.
I'm continuously enhancing the site and adding new content,
so check back soon and share your thoughts
—constructive criticism welcome, harsh judgment silently noted.

This blog will evolve alongside my learning journey,
documenting both my ideas and technical growth.
In the ever-changing web development landscape,
sometimes rebuilding from scratch is the best way forward
—or at least that's what I tell myself to justify the time spent.

Cheers to new beginnings and public learning!
(And to pretending all bugs are actually "undocumented features.")
