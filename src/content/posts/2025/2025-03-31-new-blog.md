I spent some time completely reworking my blog software. Instead of Python-Flask and Hugo, I am now using [Astro](https://astro.build) - and I couldn't be happier with the switch.

## Why the change?

My old setup, while it worked, was built from the ground up using Python with Flask.
But over time, it became a real pain to keep up.
With my next job being in web development
and me currently doing a full-stack web development bootcamp,
I figured this was the perfect chance to update my skills and give my blog a little boost.

## Starting Fresh with Astro

I decided to start completely from scratch to ensure a clean state.
I started with the Astro minimal template and added the features I wanted bit by bit.

The Astro setup was actually pretty straightforward.
I followed the instructions, and in a few hours, I had a basic site up and running.
I'm still learning the ins and outs of this framework,
but so far, it's been enjoyable.

## Migration in Progress

I'll be gradually migrating old blog posts to this new format.
There are quite a few posts from my previous blog system that need to be converted
and arranged according to Astro's folder structure.
While I don't have a specific timeline for completion,
I'm making steady progress.

## Learning Curve

Since I don't know a lot about JavaScript or TypeScript,
this change has been a bit of a challenge for me.
The hardest part for me has been getting my head around asynchronous programming concepts.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around those.
But I'm making progress every day and enjoying the learning process.

It's been really rewarding to build in public and learn new technologies at the same time.
I'm excited to keep improving my blog and my development skills.

## To Sum It Up

Switching to Astro is more than just a tech update for me.
It's a big step in my professional growth.
Switching from a custom Python-Flask solution to a modern JavaScript framework
is a perfect fit for my career path,
especially when it comes to fullstack development.

It's taking some time to switch things over,
especially moving content and getting used to new ways of programming,
but it's definitely worth it.
The site is more maintainable,
the development experience is smoother,
and I'm picking up valuable skills that will help me in my career.

I'm still working on the blog,
adding new content,
and I'd love it if you'd come back and check it out
and let me know what you think.
This blog will keep evolving along with my learning journey,
documenting both my thoughts and the technical growth happening behind the scenes.

The web development landscape is always changing,
and sometimes the best way to keep up is to rebuild from the ground up.
Cheers to new beginnings and keeping the learning public!
