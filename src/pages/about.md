# About

Hello! Iâ€™m Carsten, and welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

This website has changed a lot over the years, and right now, it's basically a
place for me to talk about the things that I'm interested in right now. Here,
you'll find my notes, thoughts, and a bunch of ideas that I hope you'll find
useful and inspiring.

## ðŸ‘‹ A Bit About Me

I was born around 336ppm and trained as an IT assistant. Currently, I work primarily as a defense contractor, focusing on Java development while dabbling in various programming languages. I also enjoy running different projects and services in my homelab.

I live in the beautiful, albeit often rainy, city of The Hague in the Netherlands with my wonderful wife. ðŸ˜Š

In my free time, I love playing video games on my Switch or PC, with *Factorio* being one of my all-time favorites. I also enjoy immersing myself in podcasts, audiobooks, and radio plays. While I proudly identify as an Apple fanboy, I have a deep appreciation for open-source software.

## RSS Feeds

I offer two RSS feeds for those interested in following my updates:

- ~~Atom feed: `/feed/` or `/feed/atom/`~~
- RSS: `/rss.xml`

(Note: Theyâ€™re currently not operational, but Iâ€™m working on it!)
