## Introduction & Caveats

Welcome to this friendly guide on how to collaborate effectively with me—Carsten.
While it's comprehensive, it's not exhaustive—
I'm always open to discussion and adaptation.

Think of it as a user-friendly guide for understanding how I work best.
Remember, everyone is unique, so while these tips apply well to me,
always feel free to ask if something isn't clear.

Disclaimer: This manual represents my preferences and habits.
What works well for me might not always work for you or apply universally.

I believe in transparency and direct communication,
which is why I'm sharing these insights.

## Language & Communication Background

- Native German (from North Rhine-Westphalia).
- Fluent in English,
  though occasionally my idioms or cultural references may not land perfectly.
  Please ask if anything is unclear.
- I appreciate quick reviews of critical documents to ensure clarity.

## Values & Communication Style

- My humor is typically dry and sometimes dark, always focused on absurdities or situations—never targeted at people or their identities.
- I consciously ensure my humor remains inclusive and respectful. If it ever misses the mark, let me know right away.
- Working in international environments means my expressions might not come always across as intended—please ask for clarification if something seems off or makes you uncomfortable.
- I have zero tolerance for [bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) or discrimination and will actively address any inappropriate behaviors I observe.
- I believe in actively supporting and protecting colleagues who face unfair treatment.

## How To Communicate With Me

- I prefer instant messaging/chat for most communications, with the understanding that it's asynchronous.
- Being based in Germany/The Netherlands (CET/CEST), my "being available" hours might not align with yours—please be timezone-aware.
- Before scheduling meetings, consider if the matter could be handled via email or chat.
- If something is truly urgent, call me—I'll answer if I'm available and willing.
- [No "hello" messages](https://nohello.net/)—please get straight to the point.
- [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).
- Use specific dates for deadlines (e.g., "by Thursday, Feb 22") rather than vague terms like "next week".
- Include all relevant information in your initial message.
- For email communication, be specific and precise with clear requirements and deadlines.
- [No "Need to chat" messages](https://medium.com/@merrylue/5-ways-leaders-can-avoid-sending-toxic-messages-to-employees-dc015698499c).
- When meetings are necessary:
  - Schedule during core working hours, avoiding evenings.
  - Include clear agendas and expected outcomes.
  - Respect everyone's time by being prepared and focused.
  - Follow up with written summaries for important decisions or action items.
  - I encourage using "smart minutes" in meetings, especially ones with an LLM behind them that can be queried for more context or information from the transcript—including 1:1s.

## Working Style Characteristics

- I balance a detail-oriented approach with practical outcomes. While I strive for excellence, I recognize when work is "good enough."
- Highly engaging tasks bring out intense focus and detailed results; less interesting tasks might require additional structure.
- I handle stressful situations calmly and effectively, focusing clearly on solutions.
- I enjoy solving problems, even if they extend beyond my direct responsibilities.
- The quality and speed of my work often correlate with how meaningful or interesting I find the task.

## Environment & Work Preferences

- I'm comfortable switching between collaborative environments and focused solo work.
- I appreciate uninterrupted periods to tackle detailed or complex tasks.
- Administrative tasks and non-core work aren't my favorite and can be challenging to focus on. Gentle reminders help keep me on track.
- Friendly nudges are welcome if you notice a missed message or follow-up.

## How You Can Help Me Succeed

- Provide sufficient uninterrupted time for complex projects.
- Keep administrative tasks minimal to help maintain my productivity.
- Involve me in brainstorming and problem-solving, as these activities motivate me.
- Allow me to work on technical challenges that interest me.
- Offer autonomy on projects I feel passionate about.
- For tight deadlines, help break tasks into manageable steps with brief check-ins.
- Check in if I become unusually quiet—I might appreciate some support or guidance.

## What People Might Misunderstand About Me

- My communication style can very blunt and direct—it could be misunderstood as anger or frustration (it isn't).
- I have strong beliefs about data privacy and protection, technical quality, and professional ethics.
- While I hold strong opinions, I'm open to discussion and different perspectives when backed by sound reasoning.

## Feedback Preferences

- I appreciate direct, constructive feedback that is specific and actionable.
- For significant feedback, I prefer receiving it during scheduled one-on-ones rather than impromptu conversations.
- If something isn't working, I'd rather know sooner than later so I can adjust course.
- For technical feedback, I value detailed explanations and clear reasoning behind suggestions.
- When providing feedback about my work:
  - Focus on specific behaviors or outcomes rather than general statements.
  - Provide examples where possible.
  - Suggest clear paths for improvement.
  - Be direct but professional—I can handle constructive criticism.
- For collaborative projects, I welcome ongoing feedback to ensure we're aligned with expectations and goals.

## Conflict Resolution

- I strongly prefer direct, person-to-person communication for addressing issues or misunderstandings.
- Don't talk about people behind their backs—address concerns directly with the person involved.
- I'm open to feedback and clarification about my communication style.
- Give direct feedback if my humor or communication style ever causes discomfort.
