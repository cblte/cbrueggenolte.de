Hello! I'm Carsten, and welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

This website has evolved over the years.
Today, it's a space where I transparently share my thoughts, notes, and ideas on topics I'm passionate about.
I firmly believe in open, direct communication
(no beating aruond the bushes),
so expect honesty‚Äî
and maybe an occasional typo

## üëã About Me

I was born around 336ppm (CO‚ÇÇ concentration in the atmosphere),
in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Growing up in a small village,
surrounded by friends and nature taught me valuable life lessons‚Äî
like knowing milk doesn't actually originate from supermarket shelves.

These days,
I live in the beautiful city of The Hague in the Netherlands
with my wonderful wife Sarah,
who graciously tolerates my collection of cables,
adapters,
and questionable tech purchases üòä.

I hope you'll find something useful or inspiring here‚Äî
and maybe even chuckle at my occasional dry humor.
Feel free to explore,
and don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact) if you have questions
or just want to say hi!

### üíª IT Background

My journey into the world of information technology began during my teenage years
when I acquired my first computer‚Äî
an [Intel 80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286)
running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).
Given how slowly games loaded back then,
patience became my first debugging skill.

As the internet evolved,
I was happy to explore new emerging technologies,
progressing from the charm of dial-up melodies and ISDN
to today's lightning-fast Fiber to the Home (FTTH).
Honeslty, though,
I'd be lying if I said
I genuinely miss waiting five minutes for a single image to download.

My first websites were built using basic HTML and CSS
(thankfully, these early masterpieces have been lost to time and broken links).
Over time, I expanded into server-side scripting with PHP,
then dove deeper into Java and Python.
Today, I use modern frameworks like Astro, Flask and Java Spring,
continually amazed by how much the tools have evolved‚Äî
while I've remained, more or less, the same geeky kid.

Facing challenges at the ‚ÄòGymnasium'‚Äî
especially Latin grammar‚Äî
I wisely transitioned to a technical college
to pursue specialized education aligned with my passion.
There, I earned the fancy-sounding title "Information Technology Assistant,"
which basically meant I could officially fix family members' computers.
Surprisingly,
it also prepared me for professional roles
involving software development and network management.

Reflecting on these experiences,
I recognize how each phase‚Äî
from early experimentation to formal education‚Äî
has shaped my professional approach.
They have instilled adaptability,
and deepened my appreciation for the transformative power of technology.
And yet, sometime, I still forget to charge my wireless mouse.

### üöÄ Today

Building on my early passion and formal education in IT,
I've cultivated a career that continues to evolve dynamically.
Currently,
I work primarily as a Java developer
and part-time DevSecOps
in the defense industry,
though I frequently experiment with a variety of other programming languages and technologies.
At home, I maintain a small-but-growing homelab,
mostly as an elaborate justification for having too many servers and blinking lights.

Over the years,
I've gained hands-on experience with
Linux, macOS, Windows administration,
Docker, Kubernets, container orchestration
Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
‚Äîthough I still occasionally Google "[how to center a div](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=kphds-1V9o8)".
Curious about the specific tools and tech I swaer by (or ocassionally at)?
Check out my [uses](/uses) or [bookmarks](/bookmarks) pages.

Outside the world of tech,
you'll probably find me gaming on my Switch or PC (_Factorio_ remains a personal favorite).
I also love listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and radio plays‚Äî
perfect for drowning out server fans.
And while I proudly identify as an Apple enthusiast,
I'm deeply passionate about open-source software‚Äî
yes, some contradictions make perfect sense.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects and Home Lab Services

Below are some of the projects and services
I host for myself, my family, and friends‚Äî
partly because I love technology,
partly to justify purchasing yet another Raspberry Pi.
