<h1 class="text-5xl/12 font-bold">Hi! Carsten here 👋.</h1>
<p class="text-2xl/12 font-bold mb-4">
  Welcome to my small corner of the internet.
</p>

<div class="prose dark:prose-invert text-lg">
  <p>
    This is <a href="/about" target="_self">personal website</a>, where I share
    my thoughts, experiences, things I collected and things I value.
  </p>
  <p>
    As someone who loves technology and podcasts, I’m excited to invite you to
    explore my different interests and find ideas that inspire you! In my blog,
    you’ll find a collection of notes, ideas, and links to websites I enjoy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to look through my digital collection and let your imagination
    wander. I’d love to hear your thoughts, so please share your ideas with me!
  </p>
  <p>
    This space is also my creative playground, where I share my reflections to
    learn and inspire others. I’ve created this digital garden to grow my
    passions openly. A ‘digital garden’ is a reminder of the early days of the
    internet, when people shared their interests just for fun, without worrying
    about clickbait and numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join me on this journey as I share my process, not just the final results.
    Together, let’s explore the world of digital thoughts and exciting
    discoveries.
