## Sharing my Setup and Tools I use

I believe in sharing the tools I use ‚Äî not just to help others but also to
document my own journey. I love learning Learning about others' setups which may
inspire me to cherry-pick for my own toolbox.  While I enjoy exploring new
tools, I've come to value stability over novelty.

Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/) and his
[uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) website, whose resource I found incredibly
helpful, here's a straightforward list of what I use daily for work, home, and
everything in between.

**Last updated on 30th March 2025.**

## üñ• Hardware

As a software engineer/developer, I've worked primarily with Microsoft Windows
throughout my professional career. However, I've been using Apple computers at
home for over 20 years because of their reliability‚ÄîI've rarely experienced
hardware issues with them.

My experience spans multiple platforms, including both backend and frontend
development. Professionally, I've mainly worked with Windows machines and
Linux/Unix on the server side, while my personal machine of choice is a MacBook
Pro.

Please note that this overview of my toolbox isn't meant as a recommendation for
what others should use, but rather a record of what has met my specific needs
over time.

* **MacBook Air 2025 (15.3-inch, M4, 32 GB RAM)** - My new primary workstation,
  offering exceptional battery life, silent fanless operation, and enough power
  to handle demanding developemtn tasks with ease.

  connectivity.

## Editor and Terminal

As a developer, I spend significant time working in terminals. This approach is
essential for managing remote machines and running multiple services without
relying on resource-intensive graphical interfaces. I consider terminal-based
workflows superior for interacting with the digital world, and I typically only
use a mouse when browsing the web.

While I primarily work in terminal-based editors, I also use modern code editors
like VS Code and Zed for specific development tasks that benefit from their
integrated features and extensions. However, my terminal remains the central hub
of my workflow.

Given the terminal's importance in my workflow, I've created a separate category
dedicated to terminal tools, as they make up a substantial portion of my
toolkit.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Feature-rich code editor with
  excellent extension ecosystem supporting virtually all programming languages
  and frameworks.
