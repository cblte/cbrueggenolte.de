## Introduction & Caveats

This user manual is a living document that outlines my working preferences, communication style, and how to best collaborate with me. While it's comprehensive, it's not exhaustive - I'm always open to discussion and adaptation.

Please note that this manual reflects my personal working style and preferences. What works for me might not work for others, even if they share similar traits or backgrounds. Every person is unique in how they work best.

I believe in transparency and direct communication, which is why I'm sharing these insights. Use this as a guide to understand my work approach better, but feel free to ask questions or seek clarification when needed.

## Language & Communication Background

- Native German speaker from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).
- Fluent in English and comfortable conducting business in either German or English.
- While my English is fluent, sometimes idioms or subtle cultural references might get lost in translation.
- Feel free to ask for clarification if any language nuances are unclear.
- When writing documentation or important communications, I appreciate a quick review to ensure nothing is lost in translation.

## Values & Communication Style

- I have a dry sense of humor and can use dark humor to deal with challenging situations or absurdities in life.
- Important: My humor is always about circumstances or situations, never about people, their identities, beliefs, backgrounds, or any protected characteristics.
- I actively ensure my humor doesn't reinforce harmful stereotypes or marginalize any groups.
- Due to working in international environments, sometimes my expressions might not come across as intended - please feel free to ask for clarification if something seems unclear or makes you uncomfortable.
- I take a strong stance against [bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) and discrimination of any kind.
- I will not remain silent in the face of injustice or when people are suffering.
- I believe in actively supporting and protecting colleagues who face unfair treatment.

## How To Communicate With Me

- I prefer instant messaging/chat for most communications, with the understanding that it's asynchronous.
- Being based in Germany/The Netherlands (CET/CEST), my "being available" hours might not align with yours - please be timezone-aware.
- Before scheduling a meeting, consider if the matter could be handled via email or chat.
- If something is truly urgent, call me - I'll answer if I'm available and willing.
- [No "hello" messages](https://nohello.net/) - please get straight to the point.
- [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).
- Use specific dates for deadlines (e.g., "by Thursday, Feb 22") rather than vague terms like "next week".
- Include all relevant information in the initial message.
- For email communication, be specific and precise with clear requirements and deadlines.
- [No "Need to chat" messages](https://medium.com/@merrylue/5-ways-leaders-can-avoid-sending-toxic-messages-to-employees-dc015698499c).
- When meetings are necessary:
  - Schedule during core working hours, avoiding evenings.
  - Include clear agendas and expected outcomes.
  - Respect everyone's time by being prepared and focused.
  - Follow up with written summaries for important decisions or action items.
  - I encourage using "smart minutes" in meetings, especially ones with an LLM behind them that can be queried for more context/information from the transcript - this includes 1:1s.

## Working Style Characteristics

- I balance perfectionism with pragmatism - I can spend hours perfecting a design (like in [Factorio](https://factorio.com/)), but I recognize when "good enough" is sufficient.
- I can get deeply hyperfocused on details others might consider minor.
- My output might vary based on engagement - when hyperfocused, I produce extremely detailed work; during periods of lower output, I might be struggling with less engaging tasks.
- I am remarkably calm in chaos - able to filter important information and act decisively during critical situations.
- I gravitate towards solving problems, whether they're my direct responsibility or not.
- I'll tackle issues I care about with intense focus, and sometimes fix things I don't particularly care about but believe should be fixed.
- The quality and speed of my work often correlates with how meaningful or interesting I find the task.

## Environment & Work Preferences

- I adapt between collaborative office settings and focused remote work based on the task at hand.
- I need uninterrupted time blocks for complex or detailed work.
- Administrative tasks and non-core work can be challenging to focus on - I appreciate reminders and structure for these.
- Things that are out of sight might slip my mind - a gentle reminder in chat is always welcome.
- If I haven't responded to a message, I might have gotten distracted after reading it - feel free to nudge me.

## How To Help Me Succeed

- Provide large blocks of uninterrupted time for deep work.
- Keep administrative overhead and processes to a minimum.
- Involve me in problem-solving and ideation.
- Allow me to work on technical challenges that interest me.
- Enable self-direction on projects I'm passionate about.
- For tasks with strict deadlines:
  - Help break them down into manageable chunks.
  - Schedule brief morning check-ins to maintain focus.
  - Help me maintain balance between quality and timely delivery.
- If you notice I've been quiet for a while, check in - I might be stuck but hesitant to ask for help.

## What People Might Misunderstand About Me

- My communication style can very blunt and direct - it could be misunderstood as anger or frustration (it is not).
- I have strong beliefs about data privacy and protection, technical quality, and professional ethics.
- While I hold strong opinions, I'm open to discussion and different perspectives when backed by sound reasoning.

## Feedback Preferences

- I appreciate direct, constructive feedback that is specific and actionable.
- For significant feedback, I prefer receiving it during scheduled 1:1s rather than impromptu conversations.
- I value clarity in feedback - tell me exactly what worked or didn't work, with concrete examples.
- If something isn't working, I'd rather know sooner than later so I can adjust course.
- For technical feedback, I value detailed explanations and reasoning behind suggestions.
- When providing feedback about my work:
  - Focus on specific behaviors or outcomes rather than general statements.
  - Provide examples where possible.
  - Suggest clear paths for improvement.
  - Be direct but professional - I can handle constructive criticism.
- For collaborative projects, I welcome ongoing feedback to ensure we're aligned with expectations and goals.

## Conflict Resolution

- I strongly prefer direct person-to-person communication for addressing issues or misunderstandings.
- Don't talk about people behind their backs - address concerns directly with the person involved.
- I'm open to feedback and clarification about my communication style.
- Give direct feedback if my humor or communication style causes any discomfort.
