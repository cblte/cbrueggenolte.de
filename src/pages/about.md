Hello! I'm Carsten, and welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

This website has evolved over the years.
Today, it's a space where I transparently share my thoughts, notes, and ideas on topics I'm passionate about.
I firmly believe in open, direct communication
(no beating aruond the bushes),
so expect honesty‚Äî
and maybe an occasional typo

## üëã About Me

I was born around 336ppm (CO‚ÇÇ concentration in the atmosphere),
in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Growing up in a small village,
surrounded by friends and nature taught me valuable life lessons‚Äî
like knowing milk doesn't actually originate from supermarket shelves.

These days,
I live in the beautiful city of The Hague in the Netherlands
with my wonderful wife Sarah,
who graciously tolerates my collection of cables,
adapters,
and questionable tech purchases üòä.

I hope you'll find something useful or inspiring here‚Äî
and maybe even chuckle at my occasional dry humor.
Feel free to explore,
and don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact) if you have questions
or just want to say hi!

## üíª My IT Journey

My journey into information technology began during my teenage years
when I acquired my first computer‚Äî
an [Intel 80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286)
running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).
Given how slowly games loaded back then,
patience became my first debugging skill.
I quickly became fascinated with technology,
spending countless hours tinkering with hardware and software.

My first websites used basic HTML and CSS,
before expanding into server-side scripting with PHP,
then Java and Python.
Today, I use modern frameworks like Astro, Flask and Java Spring,
continually amazed by how much the tools have evolved.
After my time at the "Gymnasium,"
I transitioned to a technical college
where I earned the title "Information Technology Assistant."
This prepared me for professional roles
in software development and network management.

Currently,
I work primarily as a Java developer
and part-time DevSecOps specialist,
exploring a variety of programming languages and technologies.
At home, I maintain a small-but-growing homelab,
mostly as an elaborate justification for having too many servers and blinking lights.
I've gained hands-on experience with
Linux, macOS, Windows administration,
Docker, Kubernetes, container orchestration,
Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
‚Äîthough I still occasionally Google "[how to center a div](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=kphds-1V9o8)".

Curious about the specific tools and tech I swear by?
Check out my [uses](/uses) or [bookmarks](/bookmarks) pages.

When not immersed in technology,
you'll find me gaming on my Switch
or on the PC (_Factorio_ remains a favorite),
or listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and radio plays.
And while I proudly identify as an Apple enthusiast
I'm deeply passionate about open-source software‚Äî
yes, some contradictions make perfect sense.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects and Home Lab Services

Below are some of the projects and services
I host for myself, my family, and friends‚Äî
partly because I love technology,
partly to justify purchasing yet another Raspberry Pi.
