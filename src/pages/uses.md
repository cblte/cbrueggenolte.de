## Sharing my Setup and Tools I use

I believe in sharing the tools I use —
not just to help others
but also to document my own journey.
I love learning Learning about others' setups
which may inspire me to cherry-pick for my own toolbox.
While I enjoy exploring new tools,
I've come to value stability over novelty.

Here's a straightforward list of what I use daily
for work, home, and everything in between.

## 🖥 Hardware

As a software engineer/developer,
I've worked primarily with Microsoft Windows throughout my professional career.
However, I've been using Apple computers at home for over 20 years
because of their reliability—
I've rarely experienced hardware issues with them.

My experience spans multiple platforms,
including both backend and frontend development.
Professionally, I've mainly worked with Windows machines
and Linux/Unix on the server side,
while my personal machine of choice is a MacBook Pro.

Please note that this overview of my toolbox
isn't meant as a recommendation for what others should use,
but rather a record of what has met my specific needs over time.

* **MacBook Air 2025 (15.3-inch, M4, 32 GB RAM)** -

## Editor and Terminal

As a developer, I spend significant time working in terminals.
This approach is essential for managing remote machines and running multiple services
without relying on resource-intensive graphical interfaces.
I consider terminal-based workflows superior for interacting with the digital world,
and I typically only use a mouse when browsing the web.

While I primarily work in terminal-based editors,
I also use modern code editors like VS Code and Zed
for specific development tasks that benefit from their integrated features and extensions.
However, my terminal remains the central hub of my workflow.

Given the terminal's importance in my workflow,
I've created a separate category dedicated to terminal tools,
as they make up a substantial portion of my toolkit.
