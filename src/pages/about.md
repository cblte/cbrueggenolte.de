Hello! I‚Äôm Carsten, and welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

This website has evolved over the years.
Today, it's a space where I share my thoughts, notes, and ideas on topics I'm passionate about.
I hope you'll find something useful or inspiring here!

## üëã About Me

I was born around 336ppm in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Growing up in a small village with friends,
nature and learning early on that milk doesn't come from the supermarkt.

Currently,
I live in the beautiful city of The Hague in the Netherlands
with my wonderful wife. üòä

### üíª IT Background

My journey into the world of information technology began during my teenage years
when I acquired my first computer‚Äîan [Intel 80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286)
running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).
This early exposure ignited a passion for computing
and set the foundation for my future endeavors.

As the internet evolved, I explored various connectivity technologies,
progressing from ISDN and DSL to today's Fiber to the Home (FTTH).
This early and ongoing exposure allowed me to engage with the World Wide Web from its inception.
I began creating websites using basic HTML and CSS,
incorporating PHP for server-side functionality.
Over time, I expanded my skill set to include Java and Python,
and currently, I utilize modern frameworks such as Astro and Java Spring.
This continuous learning journey has not only kept me abreast of technological advancements
but has also deepened my understanding of networking infrastructures.

Facing challenges at the 'Gymnasium' and driven by a growing passion for information technology,
I chose to transition to a technical college to pursue specialized education
aligned with my career aspirations.
There, I earned the designation of an "Information Technology Assistant,"
a comprehensive program that equipped me with the expertise to design, plan,
and implement computer systems and networks,
as well as develop software solutions tailored to diverse needs.

Reflecting on these experiences,
I recognize how each phase‚Äîfrom early experimentation to formal education‚Äî
has shaped my professional approach,
instilling in me a problem-solving mindset, adaptability,
and a deep appreciation for the transformative power of technology.

### üöÄ Today

Building upon my foundational experiences and formal education in IT,
I have cultivated a dynamic and evolving career.
Currently,
I work primarily in the defense industry specializing in Java development,
though I frequently experiment with other programming languages.
I also enjoy setting up and maintaining various projects and services in my homelab.
Over the years,
I have gained experience with systems spanning Linux and Windows administration,
Docker and Kubernetes,
Java,
Python,
JavaScript/TypeScript,
HTML,
and CSS.
I am continually expanding my knowledge
and am familiar with a variety of tools to accomplish tasks.

If you're looking for a specific tool for a particular task,
feel free to check out my [uses](/uses) or [bookmarks](/bookmarks) pages.

When I'm not working,
you'll likely find me gaming on my Switch or PC (_Factorio_ remains a personal favorite).
I also love listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and radio plays.
While I proudly identify as an Apple enthusiast,
I'm also deeply passionate about open-source software.
