Dear friends, family, and colleagues,

You might think it's harsh to judge people based on their politics, but it's
important to understand that politics isn't just about ideas or opinions. It's
about real-life consequences. If someone supports a political figure or movement
that's racist, bigoted, or denies women's right to make decisions about their
own bodies, it's not just about having a different view. It shows what they're
OK with in our society.

Politics has a direct impact on people's safety, rights and dignity. Supporting
harmful ideologies or leaders has a direct impact on those who are most
vulnerable.Ignoring that damage isn't neutral—it's enabling.Saying "this is not
okay" isn't about division; it's about standing up for a kinder, fairer society
where everyone's humanity is respected.

## The 2024 U.S. Election and the Battle for Democracy

Trump's return to power has had a huge impact on American citizens and the rest
of the world. His policies have caused a lot of disruption to humanitarian aid,
led to job losses and ended long-standing global partnerships.The whole Ukraine
situation, which was a major diplomatic scandal, has made relations with US
allies, especially in Europe, even worse, and made people less confident in US
leadership. I've been following international affairs for years, and I've
learned that true leadership means being accountable and respecting democratic
norms, not acting recklessly and dividing and destabilising.

## Reflections on the February 2025 German Elections

Here at home, the elections in Germany in February 2025 have got people talking a lot about our nation's future. It's really worrying how much influence the far-right has, especially with more and more people supporting the AfD. Anyone who believes in democratic values is concerned. And the CDU candidate, Merz, doesn't seem to know what he's doing when it comes to dealing with the big challenges we face. This shows us that if we want to make progress, we need to talk to each other instead of just criticising. But we'll have to wait and see how he does once he's officially in charge.

Christian Lindner has stepped down as leader of the FDP and resigned from politics, which I think is a positive step. The FDP was largely responsible for the collapse of the coalition at the end of 2024, after all. But there are still concerns about the return of controversial figures to our political arena. I'm not just talking about Jens Spahn, Alexander Dobrindt and Andreas Scheuer either. The AfD is also drawing in controversial figures like Krah, who's known for his extreme nationalist rhetoric and close ties to extremist networks, and Helferich, who's notorious for organising nationalist events and maintaining connections with far-right groups. With the AfD now holding 20% of the seats, it spells trouble not only for the other parties but for the AfD itself, as more radical voices within its ranks threaten to further destabilise the Bundestag.

## Understanding Political Ideologies: A Spectrum of Values

Politics is complicated, and not all disagreements come from the same place. There's a big difference between socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and—for lack of a better term—fascism. Each represents a different set of values:

- **Socialism** emphasizes collective welfare, focusing on reducing inequality and providing universal access to essentials like healthcare and education.
- **Liberalism** champions individual freedoms, equal rights, and democratic governance, balancing personal liberty with societal responsibility.
- **Conservatism** values tradition, stability, and gradual change, often emphasizing personal responsibility and free markets.
- **Fascism**, however, is fundamentally different. It thrives on authoritarian control, nationalism, and the suppression of dissent, often using fear and division as tools of power.

While healthy debate between socialism, liberalism and conservatism can strengthen a democracy, the rise of fascism or authoritarianism represents a direct threat to it. So, it's really important to understand these differences, so we can see what we're voting for and the potential consequences of our choices.

## Personal Reflections

My life experiences have taught me the importance of strategic thinking, foresight, and the power of dialogue in protecting our shared future.I've always believed that a secure and sustainable society is built on cooperation, empathy, and a commitment to progressive values.In a world where policies directly impact the most vulnerable among us, standing up for kindness, respect, and fairness is not just a choice—it's a duty. I have strong opinions on a lot of things, but these convictions are things I will never compromise on. I've seen the costs of divided leadership and the benefits of thoughtful, inclusive dialogue, and that's shaped my views.

Thanks for reading,
Carsten
