  In the February 2025 German federal election,
  the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) doubled its vote share to 20.8%,
  becoming the second-largest party in the Bundestag.
  This significant increase has reshaped Germany's political landscape and raised concerns among democratic institutions.

- [Reuters ‚Äì Merz's Spending Plans](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/merzs-spending-splurge-risks-blowback-among-german-conservatives-2025-03-24/):

  led by Christian Lindner,
  experienced a significant decline in the 2025 election,
  with their vote share dropping to 4.3%,
