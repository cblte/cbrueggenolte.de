# cbrueggenolte.de - version 2025


Here you find the source-code for my personal site built with [Astro](https://astro.build) -
an upgrade from my previous Python Flask and Hugo-based implementation.
I'm currently in the process of migrating and enhancing content from older versions of the site,
so check back regularly for updates.
The site showcases my work, projects, and thoughts with a clean, responsive design.
Feel free to explore what's available now at [cbrueggenolte.de](https://cbrueggenolte.de),
and watch as more content gets added over time!
