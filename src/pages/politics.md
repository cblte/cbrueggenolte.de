Hello friends, family, and colleagues,

I've often heard it's harsh to judge someone by their politics, but through my own experiences, I've learned politics isn’t just abstract—it’s personal. Politics directly affects real lives, real freedoms, and the kind of society we build for ourselves and future generations. Supporting political figures or movements that are racist, bigoted, or undermine basic human rights isn’t merely about differences in opinion. It reveals what values we accept and what injustices we tolerate.

Politics shapes our safety, rights, and dignity. Turning a blind eye to harmful ideologies isn’t neutral—it actively enables harm. Standing up against these ideas isn't about creating division; it's about defending a kinder, fairer society where everyone's humanity is respected.

## The 2024 U.S. Election and Democracy at Risk

Trump’s return to power has been unsettling, not just for American citizens but for the entire world. His actions disrupted humanitarian aid, cost countless jobs, and damaged long-standing global partnerships. The diplomatic chaos around Ukraine has deeply shaken the trust between the U.S. and its allies, especially here in Europe. Years of closely following international affairs have taught me one crucial lesson: true leadership is about accountability and respecting democratic norms, not recklessly dividing nations.

## Thoughts on the 2025 German Elections

Closer to home, the February 2025 elections in Germany have sparked many important conversations about our country's future. I'm genuinely concerned by the increasing influence of the far-right, especially given the growing support for the AfD. Any believer in democratic values should be alarmed. Meanwhile, the CDU candidate, Merz, seems uncertain about how to tackle our biggest challenges. While I believe dialogue is crucial, it's difficult to remain optimistic without clear leadership.

Christian Lindner's resignation as FDP leader feels like a necessary step forward, especially given the party’s role in the coalition’s collapse last year. Still, troubling figures like Jens Spahn, Alexander Dobrindt, and Andreas Scheuer linger in our political arena. And with the AfD gaining 20% of Bundestag seats and embracing controversial personalities like Krah and Helferich—known for their extreme nationalist rhetoric and troubling ties—Germany faces serious challenges ahead.

## Understanding Political Ideologies

Politics can indeed be complicated, and not all disagreements come from the same place. Consider these ideologies:

- **Socialism** focuses on collective welfare, aiming to reduce inequality and ensure everyone has access to essentials like healthcare and education.
- **Liberalism** champions individual freedoms, equal rights, and democratic governance, balancing personal liberty with social responsibility.
- **Conservatism** values tradition, stability, and incremental change, often emphasizing personal responsibility and market freedom.
- **Fascism** is fundamentally different, driven by authoritarianism, nationalism, and suppression of dissent through fear and division.

Healthy debate between socialism, liberalism, and conservatism can strengthen democracy. Fascism, on the other hand, is a direct threat to democracy itself. Understanding these differences helps us recognize the true stakes of our political choices.

## My Personal Reflections

My life experiences, both in Germany and abroad, have deepened my appreciation for stable, compassionate leadership. I’ve witnessed firsthand the consequences of divided societies, but I've also seen the incredible potential of thoughtful, inclusive dialogue. I firmly believe that cooperation, empathy, and progressive values are the foundation of a secure, sustainable future.

Standing up for kindness, respect, and fairness isn't just a choice—it’s a responsibility. While I hold strong convictions, I'm always open to conversations that challenge my perspective with reasoned arguments. But there are certain core values—like human dignity and equality—that I simply won’t compromise.

Thanks for reading,
Carsten
